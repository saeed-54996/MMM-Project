# MMM-Project üñ•Ô∏è üì∏

This is a Multi Media Management system written with the Python Flask framework, using a MySQL database.

## Features ‚ú®

-   **Pictures:** Users can upload pictures with their title, description, and tags. All pictures are shown on the pictures page.
-   **Articles:** Users can write and post articles with their title, description, and keywords. All articles are shown on the articles page.
-   **Login/Signup:** The system allows users to sign up and log in easily. All login passwords are hashed with the MD5 protocol and stored in the database's users table.
-   **Admin Roles:** The website supports roles for users. Roles are stored in the users table. To make a user an admin, set their role to "admin." Admins can manage categories and import data from CSV files in the admin panel.
-   **Filtering by Category:** A filter drop-down is available on the articles and pictures pages, allowing users to filter posts by category.
-   **Easy Navigation System:** Users can use navigation links on different pages to go back, visit their profile, go to category-filtered posts, and access other sections like the admin page and the "my-profile" page.
